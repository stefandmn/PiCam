# PiCam

**PiCam** is a surveillance application designed for motion detection and 
content streaming. The application has been designed for Raspberry Pi but 
could run on any system (most likely Linux systems) that has attached 
cameras and has in-place all software prerequisites.
 
The application is developed in python and uses SimpleCV and PiCamera libraries
and all related components.

In order to see how it works run `picam.py --help`
